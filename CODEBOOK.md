This script produces two tidy datasets using data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0. It uses five files from this dataset:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The resulting datasets shows results of experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within 
an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded 
accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant 
rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The results contain the merging of 
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

For each subject and activity, the dataset shows the mean and standard deviation for the below:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency 
of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate 
frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The first dataset contains 10,299 observations of the mean and standard deviation of the 66 variables outlined 
above. To get the resulting dataset, files for test data and lables and training data and labels were merged,
along with corresponding subject and activity (features) data. The features variables were then renamed from numbers
to their corresponding meanings. Values not expressing a mean or standard deviation were removed from the dataset.

The second dataset shows an average across each subject and activity for each of the 66 variables included in the
first dataset. Na.rm = true.
